          <h4>Visual Manufacturing</h4>
          
          <p>A new vision is emerging, founded on leveraging visualization and graphics to mobilize product data outside engineering. “Visual Manufacturing” removes the barriers to effective collaboration and efficiency by delivering visual product data to stakeholders throughout the global value chain, through user interfaces uniquely packaged to suit the needs of specific user and functions.
Product data of all types becomes accessible to thousands more people, to make faster decisions and accelerate their respective business workflows. Business processes are naturally streamlined, and Islands of Automation blend into are integrated into efficient drivers of customer value. .

Now, with those who are using the stuff that your company created (and if is quite crummy) an upgrade is an easy sell. They will complain about the price, but will ” make the investment “  – in the hope that it can be recovered through efficiency gains, especially if they are convinced that it is the “standard”. Bill Gates did well by doing that.
               </p>       
          <aside class="boxout">
               <h3>Note:</h3>
               <p>The extent and efficiency with which we can consider design possibilities it is the holy grail of generative design.</p>

          </aside>

          <h4>The business Perspective</h4>
          <p>The industry is under a pressure to develop new products personalise to the market faster than ever before.Customers demand faster turnaround and more innovative solutions, in ever compressing time cycles. This drives higher and higher production rates, pushing the limits of manufacturing systems and people. It also drives higher re-use of existing product designs. More and more, manufacturers are trying to leverage design, assemblies and component parts across product lines. For example, more automobile lines are produced on fewer chassis, while many part and assemblies are shared across multiple product lines.
Customers continue to demand ever higher quality and reliability. In response, thought leaders in virtually every industry have turned to standardized work and “lean” initiatives. By eliminating waste and non-value-added activities, companies who implement lean processes realize greater efficiency, faster response to customer needs and competitive pressures, lower costs, higher quality, and improved profitability.
What’s needed is a new focus on the seamless integration of existing business workflows, supported by advanced software technology and well planned architecture, all targeted at enhancing the ability of everyone in the value chain to leverage the latest product data created anywhere in the global engineering factory. This is the quickest path to furthering the optimization, productivity and profitability of manufacturer processes..</p>

          

          <h4>Collaboration and Communication</h4>
          <p>The value of collaboration is well established. Numerous research reports have detailed many good reasons to collaborate, and the cost of not doing it well. A recent survey of 650 manufacturing executives by Industry Week (www.industryweek.com) highlights the mission-critical nature of collaboration. 62% of purchasing executives listed supplier collaboration as the most effective contributor to increased profitability and reduced cost. More than 97% of product development executives selected collaboration with customers as the most effective strategy for meeting customer requirements and bringing innovative products to market.</p>

         

          <h4>Efficiency</h4>
          <p>Products are becoming increasingly complex. Powerful 3D CAD and engineering software tools are enabling users to create more advanced designs in less time. Powerful parametric, feature-based assembly modeling is allowing users to design extremely complex products, and
digitally assess form, fit and function in completely virtual worlds. Products often require integrated design effort between previously disconnected “islands of automation”.
</p>
          
         <p> Design and analysis/simulation, and design and manufacturing are forced closer together as companies push concurrency to extract every minute from design cycles. Similarly, disciplines like electrical and mechanical engineering are colliding as traditional boundaries blur. This is leading to new, cross-functional disciplines such as mechatronics, which require whole new advanced skill sets. It also proliferates the already overwhelming variety of incompatible data formats from even more engineering software tools, making any hope for integration all the more challenging. </p>
         
       

      

          <h4>Personalization</h4>
          <p>Customers are also demanding a “personalized” product. Huge new markets have opened for high volume products that can be customized at higher and higher levels of granularity. Mass customization puts pressure on suppliers to be highly adaptable and ready to react instantly to
change. It also drives the need for special attention to management of the countless different product configurations required to satisfy highly tuned product/market portfolios.</p>
          <p>Highly customized product configurations require more sophisticated data management systems for the huge amounts of business and product configuration data that gets created. Comprehensive, powerful enterprise and manufacturing resource planning systems, such as SAP, have evolved to manage financial, customer, supplier, warehouse, and countless other types of business data. Similarly powerful PDM/PLM systems manage terabytes of product data, such as CAD models, drawings, manufacturing process plans, annotations, manufacturing
information like tolerances and more. These ERP, MRP and PDM/PLM systems need interfaces to the operational community such that the right data is available at the right time in the right form. Success also requires the ultimate in flexibility in the tools that are implemented to support
fast changing business operations. </p>

 <p>Data and business management is further complicated by increased consolidation across all manufacturing industries. As companies are acquired or merged, disparate data and business management systems and processes must converge into new platforms. IT departments are forced to plan for change like never before. Processes like maintenance, service, parts and
warranty are often company specific, and always a core element of customer loyalty. These mission critical process are not immune to change and consolidation, and must converge into all new processes that suit the new, merged enterprise. </p>

<p>And all this must happen on a global basis. Customer and competitive pressures have led most companies to depend on global business partners for critical components.
Product design has become a globally distributed “engineering factory” consisting of in-house and outsourced engineers. Even highly specialized (and highly proprietary) products are being designed by third-party engineering service providers, who provide specialized, experienced engineering assets. A “design anywhere, manufacture anywhere” mentality forces companies to
plan and optimize capacity utilization for a single product across multiple plants in distant geographies. In a similar fashion, Supply Chains in nearly every manufacturing enterprise have become globally distributed multi-site, multi-tiered and multi-national. This creates new issues
like language barriers that must be overcome to enable global, multi-lingual manufacturing. </p>

          
          <h4>Manufacturing through Visualization</h4>
          
          <p>The quickest path to efficiency and fast response is through use of graphics, or visual data representations. Visual data representations, such as 3D graphics models, charts and control panels are quickly replacing complex tables filled with blurring numbers. Visuals lead to much
quicker understanding and faster response. In a 2008 study, AMR Research found that 42% of respondents stated that when products fail, it’s because they didn’t meet specific customer needs, or that customer needs were not clearly articulated throughout the product development
process. Visual information helps articulate more clearly.</p>

<p>The executives in the AMR study also cited a lack of communication tools as another factor that frequently leads to product failures. In another recent study, researchers at Harvard University found that learning from animations and graphical story boards for one hour
produced 10% better retention of information and 30% better understanding of information, compared to reading text books for two hours. They also found the same subjects exhibited a 10% increase in their interest and engagement in the information presented, and only half
the time spent learning.</p>
